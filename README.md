Module to generate ELO ratings for table tennis matches


The purpose of the module is to allow for workplace or school matches to be tabulated and players to be ranked according to match performance. Allows for both singles and doubles matches to be accounted for in the same ranking table. Credit to `rshk/elo` for the raw ELO functions. Also included are anonymized datasets and resultant standings from one application of this function.
